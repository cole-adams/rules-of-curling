                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>Doubles curling, also known as mixed doubles curling, is a fast paced game where the majority of play is to the center of the house. The first few rocks are crucial as you want to be the first to get to the button. Why is it called doubles curling you ask? Because a team is comprised of only two people, one female and one male.</p>

                <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>A doubles curling team is comprised of 2 players, one male and one female. Only 5 rocks are thrown instead of 8. These 5 stones are picked by the team before the game begins. These can be any combination of stones, not just the first 5. One player on the team throws the 1st and 5th stones, (first and last) and the other throws the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th stones (middle). Throwing positions can rotate each end during gameplay if the team members choose to do so.</p>

                <h1>Rock Placement & Set Up</h1>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>Before each end of play begins, two rocks are set up at the other end of the sheet. One rock in the house and the other as a guard, both aligned perfectly in the center of the sheet. This is one of many unique things about doubles curling because in a normal curling game, you start with no rocks in play. One player from each team takes one of their rocks that was not chosen to be thrown, and places it in the set positions.</p><br>
                    <p>The team who didn't score the previous end, gets to choose where they want their rock to be placed at the beginning of the next end. If that team wants to keep hammer, their rock is placed in the back four foot ring of the house. If a team chooses to give up hammer and throw first, that team's rock is placed in the guard position, half way in the guard zone on the T-line. Learn more about the strategy of choosing a rock position in the strategy section. Your opponent then places their rock in the other position, whether that be the guard or in the house. For every end of play the rocks are set up in these positions, except for when a team calls a power play.</p><br>
                    <p>How high the guard is placed from the house depends on how much curl the ice has. For instance, if the ice has lots of curl the rock would be positioned lower as it is easier to go around rocks. Whereas if the ice is straighter with not as much curl, the rock would be placed higher as it is harder to go around rocks. When you enter a doubles curling competition, or play in a league, all the information on rock placement will be given to you as it will vary with different ice.</p>
