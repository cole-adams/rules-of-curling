                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>Curling is a winter sport played on a sheet of ice with large granite stones. Invented in Scotland in the 16th century it is popular in the UK (mainly Scotland) as well as countries to which Scots have exported it, including Canada, the US, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland. In addition curling is now played in a number of other countries, including many other areas of Europe, China, Japan and Korea.</p>

                <h1>Object of the game</h1>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice towards a target area. Two teams, each of four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones, also called rocks, across the ice (curling sheet) towards the house, a circular target marked on the ice. Each team has eight stones and the purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a game; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each end, which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones.</p>

                <h1>Teams</h1>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <p>In curling, the team is made up of four players: the lead, the second, the third (also called the vice or vice-skip), and the skip. Each player has specific duties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><b>Lead: </b>The lead throws the first two rocks of the end and then sweeps the next six. The lead must be very good at throwing guards and a strong sweeper.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Second: </b>The second throws the third and fourth stones of the end and should be strong at playing takeouts. The second sweeps the first two stones and then the final four of the end. The second and the lead need to be in sync when sweeping together.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Third: </b>The third ( or vice), who throws the fifth and sixth rocks of the end, must be good at all shots, but especially draws. It is the third’s job to set up the shots that will be thrown by the skip, and to help the skip discuss the strategy of the final two stones of the end. The third also posts the score at the conclusion of the end.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Skip: </b>The skip is the captain of the team and decides the strategy. It’s the skip’s job to tell the other players where to throw their shots and when to sweep. The skip also delivers the last two shots of the end. The skip must be good at all types of shots.</p></li>

                <h1>Gameplay Basics</h1>
                <div class="card-content">
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><b>Throwing rocks: </b>Each player on the team throws two stones in each end. (An end is similar to an inning in baseball.) Each team throws 8 stones in an end. The players alternate throwing with their opposite number, the player on the other team who plays the same position they do. Each game consists of 8 or 10 ends.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Curling rocks: </b>When you throw a rock down the ice, depending on its rotation — which is applied intentionally — it will curl, or bend, one way or another. How much (or little) a rock curls or bends, depends largely on the conditions of the playing surface.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Sweeping: </b>Sweeping makes a rock curl less and travel farther. The lead, second, and third all take turns sweeping the rocks. The skip, who is like the team’s quarterback, is the only one who doesn’t regularly sweep stones.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Keeping score: </b>Once all 16 rocks have been thrown down the narrow sheet of ice, the score for that end is counted based on the final positions of the stones in the house, (the group of circles on the ice that looks like a bull’s eye). Only one team can score in an end. A team scores one point for every rock that it has closer to the center of the house than the other team.</p></li>
                        <li><p><b>Strategy: </b>Generally, the skip determines a rink’s strategy. During the game, the skip stands at one end of the sheet and tells his or her other three players where they should place their shots. A team’s strategy doesn’t always go according to plan! And that’s part of what makes curling so much fun. No two games are alike; the unpredictability is always appealing.</p></li>
